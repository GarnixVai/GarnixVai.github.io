## Reflection
-  Dr. Alice Howland, a brilliant professor that is diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50. She likes to make everything be in control, fears of something that could be unpredictable. She loves the sense of overpower and achievement. She is the one who earns admire and respect from public that exactly a research, a professor would get. Therefore, the result of diagnosis totally stunned her. It’s heartbroken to see a once fascinating and clever woman slowly deteriorating and gradually losing her mind when everything is just at the peak of her life.  She tries to remain, tries to find a way to live as normal as usual, but just couldn’t follow the pace of Alzheimer. With pieces of her own memory gradually slipping away, she starts to lose the name, lose the job, lose the directions, and lose the time. ‘’I wish I had cancer. I mean it,’’ said Alice, ’’I mean I wouldn’t be so ashamed.’’ The fear of losing the ability in society, the dignity of being a professor, and the memories with the family haunted Alice. She could be called “strong”, definitely, but Alzheimer’s disease was just an entirely terrifying beast. The only thing she could do is to accept it and to be more precisely, find a way to live “at the moment.” After all, when you are no longer who you were, and you know you will be a burden to your beloved ones, wasn’t it intolerant? Her pride and her self-esteem can’t bear this kind of thing happened, so she made an schedule to end herself,  making a video,  giving her future-self instructions on how perfectly committing a suicide.
-  Whenever read the novel or watched the film, the scene that Alice trying hard to give a speech is always the most emotional moment to me. She confesses her helpless, her heartbroken, her try of standing up, and also her efforts of not forgetting people she loved.  That’s how she deals with the disease, "So live in the moment I tell myself, it really is all I can do, live in the moment." The sight of people suffer would just make audience shed tears. Not only Alice, the Alzheimer disease patient, but also those who confronted their beloved getting the sick. They, as supporters, can do nothing but experience the pain of losing someone self. And that’s why the scene of applauding is so touching. The bound of love and the truth of their faith are just the unbreakable thing, even the monster called Alzheimer. 
-  I know Alzheimer, the disease that the old may suffer, but I never get to recognize it. After reading Still Alice, everything changed. I mean, the view point of my own life, the perspective I take toward the future. It is Alice who made the family relationship closer, and it is also Alice who told me that whatever you have got, whatever you may lose, the only thing that you could keep it forever is the one you love and being loved.

## Memorable Quotes
#### September
- Page  5 
    - She caught their reflection in the hallway mirror --- a distinguished-looking, tall man with white-flecked brown hair and glasses; a petite, curly-haired woman, her arms crossed over her chest, each readying to ==_**leap into**_== that same, bottomless argument.

insight for we readers. It's just like a kind of memory calling back, so emotional and filled with something that couldn't recover.

Maybe it is just because of the John's incomprehension.`*

    -  Alice thought about those condoms in the bathroom. What if Lydia got pregnant? Alice worried that Lydia might someday find herself trapped in a life that was unfulfilled, full of regret. She looked at her daughter and ==_**saw so much wasted potential, so much wasted time**_==.
        -  *` The continuous uses of "so much... so much" just reveal how powerless and anxious a mother could be. Either the sadness or painfulness is explicit.`*

    -  Still clutching the handle of her suitcase, she stood in the microwave. The disappointed but forgiving voice in her head faded to a whisper as the volume of a more primal one began to build and ==_**spread out.**_== She thought about calling him, but the expanding voice rejected the suggestion outright and ==_**refused all excuses.**_== She thought about deciding not to care, but the voice, now ==_**seeping down into her tips**_==, was too ==_**powerful**_== and ==_**pervasive**_== to ignore.
        -  *` Mixing emotions are just too strong to be separated at once when I read the paragraph.

    -  Why did it bother her so much? He was in the middle of an experiment and couldn't leave it to come home. She'd certainly been in his shoes innumerable times. ==_**This was what they did.**_== ==_**This was who they were.**_== The voice called her ==_**a stupid fool.**_== 
        -  *`It was related to the previous one. The emphasis of "This is...This is" just like a scream from her bottom of heart. She tried to be reasonable, but things turned out to be difficult. She somehow couldn't control herself anymore but just make a conclusion of "IDIOT ME." `*

    - Her heart began to ==_**race**_==. She started ==_**sweating**_==. She told herself that an ==_**accelerated**_== heart rate and perspiration were part of an orchestrated and appropriate response to running. But as she stood on the sidewalk, it felt like ==_**panic.**_==  
        -  *` It is the first time that the serious symptoms emerge to Alice's awareness. It drives her to the edge of mental craziness. Like a small explosion of earthquakes under a long-term pressure piling up. From now on, everything in her world seems to start to crumble.  `*

    - But the possibility that she wasn't actually in menopause snuck in,==_**grabbed on tight**_==, and ==_**wouldn't let go**_==.

        - *`Every woman would hate the reality to be stuck in menopause, but the more terrific fact is the unknown disease that an aged person could get. It is said that "when people know how time could destroy a man, and then he or she would start to be freaked out by the deprivation of everything he/she owns." From the emotional sentences I read, I just could feel the similar condition that fits the quotes.`*

    - ==_**The blood rushed from Alice's head.**_== Precisely the words she'd dreaded and only recently ==_**dared to**_== consider. With that one, professionally uttered opinion, her tidy and safe explanation ==_**shattered.**_== Something was wrong with her, and she wasn't sure that she was ready to hear what it was. She ==_**fought**_== the impulses growing louder inside her, ==_**begging**_== her to either lie down or ==_**get the hell out**_== of that examining room immediately. 
        - *` I wonder whether Alice had founded out the disease she may get. Cause the emotion she reacted was too overwhelming. I thought she may had figured out the probable result, but refused to take it. Thus, that sensible self (the voice in the text) just urge her to run away, escape from any cruel things that could happen to her.`*

      This wasn't normal. She'd begun telling herself, ==_**in a tortured and paranoid voice,**_== that she probably had a brain tumor. She also told herself not to ==_**freak out or worry**_== John until she heard the more informed voice of Dr. Moyer, which unfortunately wouldn't be until next week, after the psychonomic conference.
        - *` Every failure of her daily life becomes nothing but a torture. With these negligible and frequent symptoms getting more and more serious, Alice even couldn't convince herself with the same explanation.

## Culture Notes
- **Subject: Scone**
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oqClMRb.jpg" style="height: 300px;  margin: auto;" ></img>
- **History:** The original scone was round and flat, usually as large as a medium-sized plate. It was made with unleavened oats and baked on a griddle (or girdle, in Scots), then cut into triangular sections for serving. Today, many would call the large round cake a bannock, and call the triangles scones. In Scotland, the words are often used interchangeably.
- **Recipe:** 
	- Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Tip the flour into a large bowl with the salt and baking powder, then mix. Add the butter, then rub in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the sugar.
	- Put the milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about 30 secs until warm, but not hot. Add the vanilla and lemon juice, then set aside for a moment. Put a baking sheet in the oven.
	- Make a well in the dry mix, then add the liquid and combine it quickly with a cutlery knife – it will seem pretty wet at first. Scatter some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough out. Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it’s a little smoother. Pat into a round about 4cm deep.
	- Take a 5cm cutter (smooth-edged cutters tend to cut more cleanly, giving a better rise) and dip it into some flour. Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have four scones. By this point you’ll probably need to press what’s left of the dough back into a round to cut out another four. Brush the tops with beaten egg, then carefully place onto the hot baking tray.
	- Bake for 10 mins until risen and golden on the top. Eat just warm or cold on the day of baking, generously topped with jam and clotted cream. If freezing, freeze once cool. Defrost, then put in a low oven (about 160C/fan140C/gas 3) for a few mins to refresh
